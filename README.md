# Vision-Based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

**Vision-Based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation in Poor Visibility Conditions Using a Model-Free Robust Control**

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that can navigate in poor visibility conditions using vision-based techniques and a model-free robust control approach.

## Features

- Vision-based navigation for underwater environments
- Robust to poor visibility conditions
- Model-free control architecture

## Repository Structure

- `Vision-Based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation in Poor Visibility Conditions Using a Model-Free Robust Control_files/`  
  Contains the main implementation files and resources for the project.
